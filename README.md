# Active-Directory-Home-Lab
This project demonstrates my ability to design and deploy a full Active Directory (AD) environment from scratch using Hyper-V and Windows Server 2022. The lab simulates a real enterprise setup and covers identity management, networking, DNS, and domain administration.

## Project Overview

In this lab, I:

- Configured **Hyper-V** for virtualization  
- Installed **Windows Server 2022** inside a VM  
- Enabled **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** and **DNS**  
- Configured a **virtual switch** for network communication  
- Assigned a **static IP address** for DNS and domain services  
- Conducted a **bidirectional ping test** between the server and my local PC  
- Promoted the VM to a **Domain Controller**  
- Created a **custom domain**  
- Created two users and assigned them to **Administrators** and **Domain Users** groups  
- Joined my **Windows client PC to the domain** and signed in with an AD DS user account  

## Skills Demonstrated
